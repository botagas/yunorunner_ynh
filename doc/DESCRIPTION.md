YunoRunner is a Continuous Integration (CI) app tailored for testing YunoHost app packages. It leverages **Incus** for containerized testing environments and integrates with [package_check](https://github.com/YunoHost/package_check) to automate the validation process.

This package allows you to self-host a YunoRunner instance and use it with your own GitHub repositories. The setup process includes:

1. **Generate a GitHub Personal Access Token**:
   - Go to GitHub Developer Settings and create a token with the following permissions:
     - `read:org` (read organization metadata)
     - `repo:status` (read/write commit statuses)
     - `public_repo` (read/write pull requests for public repositories)

2. **Prepare Your Repository**:
   - Clone the [YunoHost/apps](https://github.com/YunoHost/apps) repository.
   - Add the necessary details to the `apps.toml` file in your repository.

3. **Install YunoRunner**:
   - Provide the GitHub token, select a domain, and specify the repository containing the `apps.toml` file during installation.

4. **Set Up a GitHub Webhook**:
   - Create a webhook in your GitHub repository pointing to `https://example.tld/github`.
   - Configure it to trigger on the following events:
     - `Issue Comment`
     - `Pull Request`

5. **(Optional) Add Status/Integration Badges**:
   - Enhance your app's README by including status and integration badges generated by your YunoRunner instance.

### Badge Paths
- **Status Badge**: `/api/badge/<app_name>/status`
- **Integration Badge**: `/api/badge/<app_name>/integration`
